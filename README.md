### Introduction
Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project! This is a powerful NLP library that allows you to process and analyze human language data using state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms.

NLP is a rapidly growing field that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate natural language, facilitating various applications like sentiment analysis, machine translation, chatbots, speech recognition, and much more.

This README.md file serves as a guide to help you understand the functionalities and how to use this NLP library effectively.  In specific the diference between the results of lemming and stemming producing diferent machine learning results in this case SVM, Bayes Naive and Decission Trees.

 ### Features
* *Tokenization* : Splitting text into words or sub-phrases (tokens).
* *Part-of-Speech Tagging* : Identifying the grammatical parts of speech for each token.
* *Named Entity Recognition (NER)* : Detecting and classifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations in text.
* *Text Summarization* : Generating a concise summary of a longer text.
* *Keyword Extraction* : Identifying essential keywords and key phrases from a text.

### Tech Stack
* Python
* Itertools
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Nltk

### Conclussions

In conclusion, NLP has already become an indispensable component of modern technology, transforming the way we interact with information and machines. As it continues to advance, the future of NLP holds exciting prospects for improved communication, data analysis, and automation. However, it is essential to address ethical considerations and ensure responsible development to maximize the potential benefits of NLP for humanity.
